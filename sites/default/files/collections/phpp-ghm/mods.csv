A black and white family photograph of seven men and five women. They are gathered on the porch steps of a house with a brick path. Information from the back of the photograph tells us that Ethel Longley, when given a description of this photograph, determined that it was probably a photograph of the Peak Family. The people in the photograph could just as easily be a group of friends as they appear to be close in age. Two Peak brothers, James and John, came from Ireland in 1909. Between them they had six sons and four daughters so it is possible that this is a family group.	1910				Poweshiek History Preservation Project		Grinnell Historical Museum (Grinnell, Iowa) Archives ~ provenance history					Grinnell Historical Museum | Families				1910s | 1920s | Family Life		Digital Grinnell ~ host | Poweshiek History Preservation Project ~ host | Grinnell Historical Museum ~ host	still image	Photograph	1 photograph, black and white, 6.5x8.75 inches			digitized other analog			grinnell:26652	http://hdl.handle.net/11084/26652			Copyright to this work is held by the author(s), in accordance with United States copyright law (USC 17).
