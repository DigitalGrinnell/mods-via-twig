These coins were originally
    identified and catalogued by Danja Foss ’91, with revisions by Sarah Hubbard ’17 and Monessa
    Cummins, Associate Professor of Classics. Sarah Hubbard photographed the coins for use in this
    database. Descriptions of Republican coins are based on those of the British Museum’s online
    database, Roman Republican Coins, which is based on the work of M. H. Crawford, Roman Republican
    Coinage (1974). Descriptions of imperial coins are based on those of the multi-volume reference
    work, Roman Imperial Coinage (1923–94), which was begun by Harold Mattingly and Edward Allen
    Sydenham, and continues to be revised today. This database exists because of the indispensable
    expertise of the staff of Burling Library."	2016				Grinnell College													Digital Grinnell ~ host	mixed material							English ~ eng					"Copyright to this work is held by the author(s), in
