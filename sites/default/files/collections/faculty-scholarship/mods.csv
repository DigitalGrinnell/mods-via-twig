scene text that integrates character and word segmentation
with recognition. Using wavelet features, it requires
only approximate location of the text baseline
and font size; no binarization or prior word segmentation
is necessary. Our system is aided by a lexicon,
yet it also allows non-lexicon words. To facilitate inference
with a large lexicon, we use an approximate
Viterbi beam search. Our system performs robustly on

only approximate location of the text baseline
and font size; no binarization or prior word segmentation
is necessary. Our system is aided by a lexicon,
yet it also allows non-lexicon words. To facilitate inference
with a large lexicon, we use an approximate
Viterbi beam search. Our system performs robustly on
low-resolution images of signs containing text in fonts
atypical of documents."	2008				Grinnell College							Optical pattern recognition | Markov processes | Computer simulation | Text processing (Computer science)				Scene text recognition		Digital Grinnell ~ host	Article							English ~ eng	grinnell:10961	http://hdl.handle.net/11084/10961			Copyright to this work is held by the author(s), in accordance with United States copyright law (USC 17).

He also sets a new challenge for sociology: explaining the time dynamics of social interaction. However, despite heavy reliance on the quantitative concept of positive feedback loops in his theory, Collins presents no mathematical specification of the dynamic relationships among his variables. This article seeks to fill that gap by offering a computational model that can parsimoniously account for many features of Collins’s theory. My model uses perceptual control theory to create an agent-based computational model of the time dynamics of conflict. With greater conceptual clarity and more wide-ranging generalizability, my alternative model opens the door to further advances in theory development by revealing dynamic aspects of conflict escalation not found in Collins’s model.	2014			2014-06-16	American Sociological Association		McClelland, Kent.

Economics Department. ~ supporting host	We provide a theoretical foundation for analyzing how social stigma and adopted behavioral traits affect the transmission of HIV across a population. We combine an evolutionary game-theoretic model—based on a relationship signaling stage game—with the SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) model of disease transmission. Our evolutionary model specifies how two types of social stigma—that which accompanies an HIV+ condition and that which follows associating with an HIV+ partner—influence behavioral propensities to honestly report one’s condition (or not) and to unconditionally accept relationships (or not). With respect to reporting an HIV+ condition, we find that condition stigma impedes the fitness of honest reporting, whereas association stigma impedes the relative fitness of concealing an HIV+ condition; and both propensities can coexist in a polymorphic equilibrium. By linking our model to the SIR model, we find that condition stigma unambiguously enhances disease transmission by discouraging both honest reporting and a society’s acceptance of AIDS education, whereas association stigma has an ambiguous impact: on one hand it can impede HIV transmission by discouraging concealing behavior and unconditional relationship acceptance, but it also compromises a society’s acceptance of AIDS education. Our relatively simple evolutionary/SIR model offers a foundation for numerous theoretical extensions—such as applications to social network theory—as well as foundation for many testable empirical hypotheses.	2014	25 August 2014		2014-08-25	Grinnell College		“Social Context and the Spread of HIV: A game-theoretic investigation on impacts of social stigma and HIV education on epidemic outcomes,” William D.

Economics Department. ~ supporting host	Undergraduate economics lags behind cutting-edge economic theory. The author briefly reviews six related advances that profoundly extend and deepen economic analysis: game-theoretic modeling, collective-action problems, information economics and contracting, social preference theory, conceptualizing rationality, and institutional theory. He offers suggestions for incorporating these into the undergraduate classes at various levels. He argues that game-theoretic representation of collective action problems offers a unifying framework, on par with supply and demand, for political economy. Blending in the other developments deepens our micro-level understanding of internal and external contract enforcement, with implications on nonclearing markets, power, and distribution. At the macro level, these concepts illuminate the role of institutions in economic development and long-term growth. Undergraduate curricula should incorporate these new approaches.	2011	2011-01-06		2011-01-06	University of Nebraska		Ferguson, William D. “Curriculum for the Twenty-first Century: Recent Advances in Economic Theory and Undergraduate Economics,” Journal of Economic Education 42(1), January, 2011, 31-50.

Economics Department. ~ supporting host	The operation of labor markets differs fundamentally from that of other markets because the commodity traded, hours of labor time, cannot be separated from human beings. Efficiency wage models, and effort-regulation (or shirking) models in particular address the issue of individual motivation by explicitly considering the influence of the wage on the worker's decision concerning the level of effort exerted.

Economics Department. ~ supporting host	This paper investigates causes of the dramatic increase in the wage-productivity gap—the divergence between the growth rates of aggregate productivity and real wages - in the post-1981 period. Using a two-step estimation procedure which incorporates three-digit industry wage regression coefficients into an aggregate wage growth identity equation, it finds that employment decline within unionized industries explains 18% of the post-1981 increase in the gap and that declining union ability to raise wages may explain as much as another 25%. Imports, on the other hand, do not appear to explain the gap independently of employment effects.	1996	1996			Sage Publications							Employee motivation | Wages | Collective bargaining			Nineteen eighties			Digital Grinnell ~ host | Faculty Scholarship ~ host	text	article, post-print	40 pages		application/pdf	born digital		English ~ eng	grinnell:11680	http://hdl.handle.net/11084/11680			Copyright to this work is held by the author(s), in accordance with United            States copyright law (USC 17).

Economics Department. ~ supporting host	This paper addresses implicit bargaining power within employment relationships using a versatile model of labor market segmentation that combines labor discipline, performance pay, insider power, and fair wage principles. In the primary sector, fair wage comparisons, firm-specific human capital, and less perfect monitoring engender bilateral bargaining power, yielding high compensation, sometimes including a bonus. Secondary-sector employers exert unilateral bargaining power, via credible dismissal threats with no replacement costs, and offer no bonuses. Differential determinates of implicit bargaining power can potentially explain various phenomena, including nominal wage rigidity, union wage differentials, job-specific wage differentials, and gender or race-based wage differentials.	2005	March 2005		2005-03	Mohr Siebeck GmbH & Co.

Comments [in brackets] thus reflect my interests and biases at some point in the last 30+ years, and I have occasionally added comments for students and others who might use this bibliography. The more recent notes tend to be longer as my memory gets shorter. Although irregular, the annotations and titles make it possible to search somewhat by key words and authors.

III. Phenotypic selection across a subspecies		Eckhart, V. M. ~ creator | Anderson, J. T. ~ creator | Geber, M.A. ~ creator	Grinnell College. Biology Department. ~ supporting host	Sister taxa often differ phenotypically, yet we generally do not know whether trait divergence reflects adaptation to spatially-varying selection. In a reciprocal transplant experiment, we ask whether selection favors the native phenotype in two parapatric subspecies of Clarkia xantiana (Onagraceae), an annual plant endemic to California. We quantified phenotypic selection in each of the exclusive ranges and the contact zone in two years with contrasting climates. We predicted that in the arid, pollinator-scarce eastern region of the distribution, phenotypes of the native subspecies (parviflora) have an advantage: small leaves, slow leaf growth, accelerated flowering, and diminutive flowers. In the wetter, pollinator-rich, western range of subspecies xantiana, we expected selection for the opposite phenotypes. We predicted that temporal variation in selection would favor xantiana¬-like traits during the first wet El Niño year and parviflora-like traits in the second dry La Niña year. For subspecies xantiana, selection generally favored native phenotypes in the native garden. However, for parviflora, selection sometimes favored non-native trait values. We found little evidence for pollinator-mediated selection, subspecies differences in pollen limitation to reproduction, or temporal variation in selection. Phenotypic differentiation appears to reflect divergent selection in xantiana, but not parviflora.	2015	2015			Grinnell College		Anderson JT, Eckhart VM, Geber MA (2015) Experimental studies of selection and adaptation in Clarkia xantiana (Onagraceae).

In particular, this new method allows us to produce many new examples of genera for which there is a curve with completely decomposable Jacobian. These examples greatly extend the list given by Ekedahl and Serre of genera containing such curves, and provide more evidence for a positive answer to two questions they asked. Additionally, we
produce new examples of families of curves, all of which have completely decomposable Jacobian varieties. These families relate to questions about special subvarieties in the moduli space of principally polarized abelian varieties."	2016			2016-06-08	Grinnell College		To appear in Experimental Mathematics.

Political Science Department. ~ supporting host	This paper examines the potential role of houses of worship as institutions where individuals can acquire civic skills that can be deployed for political participation in the world’s largest Muslim-majority democracy: Indonesia. Drawing on participant observation of almost 300 worship and non-worship gatherings in seven Muslim, Protestant, and Catholic religious communities in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, as well as interviews with members of these communities, this paper investigates two key questions: 1) what opportunities exist for members of Indonesian worship communities to develop and practice the civic skills that are believed to facilitate political participation? and 2) does civic skill opportunity vary across religious denominations? The study introduces an original Civic Skill Opportunity scale, which, when tested, shows that mosques are less likely to develop the civic skills among their worshippers than are churches. These denominational differences can be explained by a house of worship’s embeddedness in a confessional hierarchy, style of worship, and the relative size of the religious denomination. This study’s findings could have important implications regarding how we think about religion in Southeast Asia, especially Islam, as an impediment or incubator of democracy.	2016			2016-04-01	Grinnell College		Paper prepared for the Midwest Political Science Association Annual Meeting ~ venue | Harris Faculty Fellowship, Committee in Support of Faculty Scholarship ~ sponsor/funding agency					Mosques. | Mosques as community centers. | Islam. | Democracy.

Physics Department. ~ supporting host	The mathematical parallels between electrostatics and laminar fluid flow are exploited to develop a set of exercises that allow introductory physics students to discover Gauss’s Law. The primary fluid experiment involves investigating the continuity equation in two dimensions by examining the flow between two closely spaced plates. Extrapolation of the resulting two-dimensional velocity field to three dimensions reveals a radial dependence to the velocity field that is analogous to Coulomb’s Law.

A. ~ creator | Brown, Jonathan M., 1961- ~ creator | Getty, T. ~ creator	Grinnell College. Biology Department ~ supporting host	The hypothesis that ecological differences play a role in the evolution of body colour variation within and between sexes in a radiation of endemic Hawaiian damselﬂies is tested.	2016						Variation in traits that are sexually dimorphic is usually attributed to sexual selection, in part because the inﬂuence of ecological differences between sexes can be difﬁcult to identify. Sex-limited dimorphisms, however, provide an opportunity to test ecological selection disentangled from reproductive differences between the sexes. Here, we test the hypothesis that ecological differences play a role in the evolution of body colour variation within and between sexes in a radiation of endemic Hawaiian damselﬂies. We analysed 17 Megalagrion damselﬂies species in a phylogenetic linear regression, including three newly discovered cases of species with female-limited dimorphism. We ﬁnd that rapid colour evolution during the radiation has resulted in no phylogenetic signal for most colour and habitat traits. However, a single ecological variable, exposure to solar radiation (as measured by canopy cover) signiﬁcantly predicts body colour variation within sexes (female-limited dimorphism), between sexes (sexual dimorphism), and among populations and species. Surprisingly, the degree of sexual dimorphism in body colour is also positively correlated with the degree of habitat differences between sexes. Speciﬁcally, redder colouration is associated with more exposure to solar radiation, both within and between species. We discuss potential functions of the pigmentation, including antioxidant properties that would explain the association with light (speciﬁcally UV) exposure, and consider alternative mechanisms that may drive these patterns of sexual dimorphism and colour variation. ~ note | Cooper, I.A., Brown, J.M., & Getty, T. 2016.

Grinnell College. Libraries. ~ supporting host	George Gershwin‘s folk opera Porgy and Bess celebrated its 75th anniversary with nearly as much controversy as when it premiered in 1935. While the opera is known for sparking the professional careers of many African American vocalists, its storyline has been thought to portray African Americans negatively. Secondly, despite the unquestioned musical quality of Porgy and Bess, companies, directors, and critics continue to debate whether to treat it as an opera, a musical, or a hybrid of the two. Furthermore, singing roles in staged productions of the opera, at least in the United States. are restricted to Black vocalists, challenging companies that would have to import enough Blacks to fill the opera‘s solo and choral parts.	2011			2011-10	IMSLP journal		"Jones, Randye L.

An approach with historical precedent, reliance on data was prominent under Obama, and is even under Trump, despite signals to the contrary. This article examines three cases from the Obama era: microtargeting in electoral campaigns, performance management in government, and signature drone strikes employed by the national security apparatus. It also reflects on the early Trump administration. The processes described are highly dependent on data, technically big data in two instances. The article examines the cases both on their own terms and in the context of a critical lens that directs attention to the political economy of the data. The analysis helps unpack the allure of data and analytics as well as the challenges in structuring an environment with a measured approach to data and big data, which would examine both their potential and drawback. ~ note | Trish, B.

Although several authors further discussed the need to adopt a demographic perspective of the ecological niche theory, very few have investigated the environmental requirements of different components of species’ life cycles (i.e. vital rates) in order to examine their internal niche structures. It therefore remains unclear how species’ demography, niches and distributions are interrelated. Using comprehensive demographic data for two well-studied, short-lived plants (Plantago coronopus, Clarkia xantiana), we show that the arrangement of species’ demographic niches reveals key features of their environmental niches and geographic distributions. In Plantago coronopus, opposing geographic trends in some individual vital rates, through different responses to environmental gradients (demographic compensation), stabilize population growth across the range. In Clarkia xantiana, a lack of demographic compensation underlies a gradient in population growth, which could translate in a directional geographic range shift. Overall, our results highlight that occurrence and performance niches cannot be assumed to be the same, and that studying their relationship is essential for a better understanding of species’ ecological niches. Finally, we argue for the value of considering the assemblage of species’ demographic niches when studying ecological systems, and predicting the dynamics of species geographical ranges. ~ note | Pironon S, Villellas J, Thuiller W, Eckhart VM, Geber MA, Moeller DA, García, MB.

1. Theory predicts that lack of heritable trait variation and/or maladaptive gene flow can promote the formation of species geographical range boundaries even in the absence of barriers to dispersal. Little is known, however, about the patterns and drivers of differentiation across species’ ranges and whether they influence boundary formation in the field.
2. Using field measurements, two common garden studies, and QST–FST analyses, we examined environmental and genetic influences on plant phenotype across the geographical range of Clarkia xantiana ssp. xantiana. This annual plant endemic to California has an eastern range border that lacks obvious physical barriers to dispersal.
3. We find that across opposing environmental gradients that span the species core range, populations are likely to be locally adapted. Populations are phenotypically differentiated from each other in the field as well as common gardens. Traits are correlated with field environmental variables in both settings, and QST –FST comparisons indicate variation in flowering time, degree of branching, and herkogamy may be adaptive. The strength and direction of environment-trait correlations at the range edge are similar to the range centre, and quantitative genetic variation is not reduced. Genetic correlations between traits are generally weak, also suggesting little constraint on trait evolution at the range edge.
4. Synthesis. For traits measured here, it is unlikely that either low heritable variation at the range edge or maladaptive gene flow strongly inhibits eastward range expansion. Our results suggest that across environmentally complex landscapes, patterns of diversity generated by locally adaptive selection do not necessarily contribute broadly to the formation of range boundaries as predicted. ~ note | Gould BA, Moeller DA, Eckhart VM, Tiffin P, Fabio E, Geber MA.

Understanding the factors that afect rates of adaptation at range margins is thus crucial for interpreting and predicting changes in species’ ranges. Te spatial structure of environmental conditions is one of the determinants of whether and how quickly adaptations occur. However, while landscape structures at range edges are typically complex, most theoretical work has so far focused on relatively simple environmental geometries.
Using an individual-based allelic model, we explore the efects of diferent landscape structures on the rate of adaptation to novel environments and investigate how these structures interact with the genetic architecture of the trait governing adaptation and the dispersal capacity of the considered species. Generally, we fnd that rapid adaptation is favored by a good match between the coarseness of the trait’s genetic architecture (many loci of small efects versus few loci of large efects) and the coarseness of the landscape (abruptness of transitions in environmental conditions). For example, in rugged landscapes, adaptation is quicker for genetic architectures with few loci of large efects, while for shallow gradients the opposite is true. Moreover, dispersal capacities afect the rate of adaptation by modulating the ‘apparent coarseness’ of the landscape: a gradient perceived as smooth by species with limited dispersal capacities appears rather steep for highly dispersive ones. We also fnd that the distribution of evolving phenotypes strongly depends on the interplay of landscape structure and dispersal capacities, ranging from two distinct phenotypes for most rugged landscapes, over the co-occurrence of an additional third phenotype for highly dispersive species, to the whole range of phenotypes on smooth gradients.
By identifying basic factors that drive the fxation probability of newly arising benefcial mutations, we hope to further broaden the understanding of evolutionary adaptation at range margins and, hence, species’ range dynamics. ~ note | Gould, B; Moeller DA; Eckhart VM; Tiffin P; Fabio E; Geber, MA.

The potential parallel between the distinctive habits of particular genera and species and their wood anatomy provides other questions. For example, is raylessness in some Hydrophyllaceae the result of secondary woodiness, as appears to be the case in other families?

This paper reports the effects of variation in floral display on the visitation behaviour of this species' pollinators (mainly pollen-collecting solitary bees) in several natural and three experimental plant populations, and discusses the results in terms of the consequences for plant fitness. The working hypotheses were: (1) that because female plants do not produce pollen, pollen-collecting insects would visit hermaphrodite plants at a higher rate than female plants and would visit more flowers per hermaphrodite than per female; and (2) that pollinator arrival rate would increase with flower size and flower number, the two main components of visual display. These hypotheses were generally supported, but the effects of floral display on pollinator visitation varied substantially among plant populations. ~ note | Eckhart, V. M. (1991).

I. SOURCES OF TRAIT VARIATION ACROSS A SUBSPECIES BORDER		Eckhart, V. M. ~ creator | Geber, Monica A. ~ creator | McGuire, Christopher M. ~ creator	Grinnell College. Biology Department. ~ supporting host	We report fndings of reciprocal transplant experiments intended to tease apart the roles of differentiation and plasticity in producing phenotypic variation across a geographic border between two plant subspecies. Clarkia xantiana ssp. xantiana and C. xantiana ssp. parvifora are California-endemic annuals that replace each other along a west–east gradient of declining precipitation.	2004				Grinnell College		Abstract. Both genetic differentiation and phenotypic plasticity might be expected to affect the location of geographic range limits. Co-gradient variation (CoGV), plasticity that is congruent with genetic differentiation, may enhance performance at range margins, whereas its opposite, counter-gradient variation (CnGV) may hinder performance. Here we report fndings of reciprocal transplant experiments intended to tease apart the roles of differentiation and plasticity in producing phenotypic variation across a geographic border between two plant subspecies. Clarkia xantiana ssp. xantiana and C. xantiana ssp. parvifora are California-endemic annuals that replace each other along a west–east gradient of declining precipitation. We analyzed variation in foral traits, phenological traits, and vegetative morphological and developmental traits by sowing seeds of 18 populations (six of ssp. xantiana and 12 of ssp. parvifora)at three sites (one in each subspecies’ exclusive range and one in the subspecies’ contact zone), in two growing seasons (an exceptionally wet El Nin˜o winter and a much drier La Nin˜a winter). Signifcant genetic differences between subspecies appeared in 11 of 12 traits, and differences were of the same sign as in nature. These fndings are consistent with the hypothesis that selection is responsible for subspecies differences. Geographic variation within subspecies over part of the spatial gradient mirrored between-subspecies differences present at a larger scale. All traits showed signifcant plasticity in response to spatial and temporal environmental variation. Plasticity patterns ranged from spatial and temporal CoGV (e.g., in node of frst fower), to spatial CnGV (e.g., in fowering time), to patterns that were neither CoGV nor CnGV (the majority of traits). Instances of CoGV may refect adaptive plasticity and may serve to increase performance under year-to-year environmental variation and at sites near the subspecies border. However, the presence of spatial CnGV in some critical traits suggests that subspecies ranges may also be constrained by patterns of plasticity. ~ note | Eckhart, V. M., Geber, M. A., & McGuire, C.

Biology Department. ~ supporting host	We examine the contribution of plant–pollinator interactions to the geographic range limit of the California endemic plant Clarkia xantiana ssp. xantiana. We show that pollinator availability declined from the center to the margin of the geographic range consistently across four years of study.	2012				Grinnell College		Abstract. Mutualisms are well known to influence individual fitness and the population dynamics of partner species, but little is known about whether they influence species distributions and the location of geographic range limits. Here, we examine the contribution of plant–pollinator interactions to the geographic range limit of the California endemic plant Clarkia xantiana ssp. xantiana. We show that pollinator availability declined from the center to the margin of the geographic range consistently across four years of study. This decline in pollinator availability was caused to a greater extent by variation in the abundance of generalist rather than specialist bee pollinators. Climate data suggest that patterns of precipitation in the current and previous year drove variation in bee abundance because of its effects on cues for bee emergence in the current year and the abundance of floral resources in the previous year. Experimental floral manipulations showed that marginal populations had greater outcross pollen limitation of reproduction, in parallel with the decline in pollinator abundance. Although plants are self-compatible, we found no evidence that autonomous selfing contributes to reproduction, and thus no evidence that it alleviates outcross pollen limitation in marginal populations. Furthermore, we found no association between the distance to the range edge and selfing rate, as estimated from sequence and microsatellite variation, indicating that the mating system has not evolved in response to the pollination environment at the range periphery. Overall, our results suggest that dependence on pollinators for reproduction may be an important constraint limiting range expansion in this system. ~ note | Moeller, D. A., Geber, M. A., Eckhart, V.

Indeed, at many smaller colleges, there are the only courses in statistics available for credit towards a math major. A group of statistics educators, with support from the Sloan Foundation's New Liberal Arts Program, has been investigating alternatives to this approach. Our goal is to capture the interest of  mathematically talented students and encourage them to pursue further work in statistics. We believe that this goal can be addressed by developing an applied statistics course which exposes students more quickly to the joys of data analysis, emphasizes the applications of statistics, and utilizes their ability/interest in mathematics. The need for such an alternative course, potential pitfalls in its development, and several specific models for its implementation will be discussed.	1991				Grinnell College							Mathematics | Statistics						Digital Grinnell ~ host | Faculty Scholarship ~ host	text	article	8 pages		application/pdf	digitized other analog	RG-O Series 25	English ~ eng	grinnell:26691	http://hdl.handle.net/11084/26691				https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13fAh_Ndwq2RIG6DxTNrkF_s9UMb-I9gYtUYWahIiVmA/edit?ts=5d23ae00#gid=464539922	99

Chemistry Department. ~ supporting host	LaFexCo(1−x)O3 thin films were prepared on fluorine-doped tin oxide conducting glass substrates by spray pyrolysis without any conductive additives and evaluated for their ability to catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction. Onset potential and current density were found to be comparable to platinum, and the  resulting crystallite size was on the order of 20 nm. Coordination of the precursor metal ions by citrate was found not to be advantageous. Results from multiple scan linear sweep voltammetry suggest lattice oxide saturation during reduction of oxygen and lattice oxide depletion upon water oxidation. The color of  the best-performing composition changes dramatically between 1.2 and −1.15 V versus saturated calomel electrode, so X-ray photoelectron spectra of the fully oxidized and reduced films were compared, demonstrating that cobalt in the film changes oxidation state. Performance of the films as a function of iron-to-cobalt ratio is consistent with what others have reported in the literature, indicating that spray pyrolysis is an efficient method to prepare and evaluate new catalytic materials.	2017	2017/11/8			Grinnell College		"LaFexCo(1–x)O3 Thin-Film Oxygen Reduction Catalysts Prepared Using Spray Pyrolysis without Conductive Additives

These types of results have some interesting consequences to questions of ranks of elliptic curves and ranks of their twists.	2008	2013-11-14		2008-08-31	Grinnell College		Paulhus, Jennifer. 2013.

Motivated by a recent experiment involving which-way measurement in atom interference, we developed a completely analogous experiment using visible light. This simple experiment, easily accessible to undergraduate students and the resources of undergraduate departments, facilitates examination of the key elements of which-way measurement, quantum erasure and related mysteries of quantum measurement. The experiment utilizes a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, and visually demonstrates the loss of interference fringes when a which-way measurement is imposed, and the restoration of that pattern when the which-way information is destroyed. This device is also sensitive enough to observe interference fringes arising from single photons. At a level accessible to undergraduates, we present simple analyses of the interference appropriate for the coherent classical field limit, and the single photon limit. We briefly mention related issues of the nature of the photon, pointing to some useful references.	2002			2002-03	American Association of Physics Teachers							Study and teaching | Interference (Light) | Physical measurements | Physics						Liberal Arts Scholarly Repository ~ host | Faculty Scholarship ~ host	text	article, pre-print	16 pages		application/pdf	born digital		English ~ eng	Grinnell:47	http://hdl.handle.net/11084/47			Copyright to this work is held by the author(s), in accordance with United States copyright law (USC 17).

Libraries ~ supporting host	"Scholarly communication, in addition to referring to the disciplinary practices that structure the dissemination of scholarly knowledge, has become shorthand for two meanings: on the one hand, it refers to an analytic ""author/reader"" framework that seeks critical understanding of the entire life cycle of scholarly knowledge and the connected roles of researchers, teachers, students, funders, libraries, publishers, and other kinds of agencies in the creation, dissemination, critique, reuse, and preservation of knowledge. On the other hand, it embraces a public policy advocacy framework that critically examines the economic and legal relationships that constrain or facilitate the creation and flow of scholarly knowledge, urging recognition that knowledge is a kind of commons, with each discovery or innovation dependent on the accomplishments of earlier scholars. Despite the strong connections between the scholarly communications reform movement and research universities and research libraries, the economic, technological, and cultural changes under way in scholarly publishing affect many types of higher education institutions. Liberal arts colleges and their libraries also have a deep stake in the availability of scholarly literature and active engagement in efforts to illuminate and reform the scholarly publishing system, and have actively contributed to the movement. Many of the open access initiatives associated with the scholarly communication reform movement are directly relevant to the inquiry-based pedagogy characteristic of liberal arts college education."	2012				American Library Association		Fyffe, Richard.

Using wavelet features, it requires only approximate location of the text baseline and font  size; no binarization or prior word segmentation is necessary. Our system is aided by a lexicon, yet it also allows non-lexicon words. To facilitate inference with a large lexicon, we use an approximate Viterbi beam search. Our system performs robustly on low-resolution images of signs containing text in fonts atypical of documents.	2008						"Copyright

Libraries ~ supporting host	"This paper is a critical reconstruction of Luciano Floridi’s view of librarianship as “stewardship of a semantic environment,” a view that is at odds with the dominant tradition in which library and information science (LIS) is understood as social epistemology. Floridi’s work helps to explain the normative dimensions of librarianship in ways that epistemology does not, and his Philosophy of Information frames librarians’ traditional stewardship role in terms appropriate for our growing involvement in the management and preservation of information through its entire life cycle. Floridi’s work also helps illuminate what is coming to be called “knowledge as a commons.” Librarianship is concerned with maintaining and enhancing information environments over time, environments that include the behavior of the people who create and use them. The integrity of these environments makes possible the epistemic projects of faculty, students, and other researchers, but librarianship is not, itself, epistemological. Floridi’s ecological reframing of philosophy of information and information ethics, bridging the dichotomy between information and user, has a variety of implications for information literacy education and other academic library services in higher education.

Libraries. ~ supporting host	Learn why Grinnell College Libraries enjoyed a 60% increase in the number of Library Labs, our customized research appointments, during fall 2011.  Research consultations are well established instructional options in many academic libraries and have been offered at Grinnell for nearly 20 years.  In this poster session, we will show how we promote, conduct, and assess our one-on-one information literacy sessions on topics such as analysis of the Occupy Movement’s protest signs, Aztec blood symbolism, and gender equity indices.  We’ll also illustrate the positive connection between Library Labs and our classroom instruction as well as plans for expanding this successful one-on-one instruction option beyond the reference desk—to librarians’ offices, special collections, and academic support centers across campus—while maintaining its effectiveness.	2012			2012-06-23	Grinnell College							Educational tests and measurements | Information literacy | Student-centered learning | Library outreach programs		Grinnell (Iowa)	2008 | 2012	Assessment		Liberal Arts Scholarly Repository ~ host | Digital Grinnell ~ host | Faculty Scholarship ~ host	mixed material	poster	1 sheet		application/pdf	born digital		English ~ eng	grinnell:68	http://hdl.handle.net/11084/68			Copyright to this work is held by the author(s), in accordance with United States copyright law (USC 17).

Special Collections ~ Supporting host	Books all over the world continue to undergo an evolution, which began many centuries ago, to achieve the appearance that we are familiar with today.  In both the Eastern world and the West, practically every aspect of the printed book has changed.  From the physical appearance of the book, to the location of the title page, to the variety of production methods and uses of illustrations, and from papyrus scrolls, to bound volumes, to e-readers, books today may bear no resemblance to their previous incarnations.	2011	2011			Grinnell College Libraries.
