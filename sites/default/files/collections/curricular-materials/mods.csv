Economics Department. ~ supporting host	Undergraduate economics lags behind cutting-edge economic theory. The author briefly reviews six related advances that profoundly extend and deepen economic analysis: game-theoretic modeling, collective-action problems, information economics and contracting, social preference theory, conceptualizing rationality, and institutional theory. He offers suggestions for incorporating these into the undergraduate classes at various levels. He argues that game-theoretic representation of collective action problems offers a unifying framework, on par with supply and demand, for political economy. Blending in the other developments deepens our micro-level understanding of internal and external contract enforcement, with implications on nonclearing markets, power, and distribution. At the macro level, these concepts illuminate the role of institutions in economic development and long-term growth. Undergraduate curricula should incorporate these new approaches.	2011	2011-01-06		2011-01-06	University of Nebraska		Ferguson, William D. “Curriculum for the Twenty-first Century: Recent Advances in Economic Theory and Undergraduate Economics,” Journal of Economic Education 42(1), January, 2011, 31-50.

The primary fluid experiment involves investigating the continuity equation in two dimensions by examining the flow between two closely spaced plates. Extrapolation of the resulting two-dimensional velocity field to three dimensions reveals a radial dependence to the velocity field that is analogous to Coulomb’s Law. This analogy allows the student to predict an electric version of the continuity equation that is Gauss’s Law.	2004	2004-09-13		2004-10	American Association of Physics Teachers		"Schneider, Mark B.

Discussions of multiculturalism, race and gender equality, political correctness, and much else have helped fuel sometimes stormy debates about what college students ought to learn and how. But these debates are not new, especially in American education. In this tutorial we shall examine both recent controversies and their predecessors in an effort to establish our own criteria for the proper definition of liberal education in late twentieth-century America. These discussions will conclude with each student creating his or her own four-year course of study, together with an essay justifying it on the principles of liberal education.	1997				Grinnell College							Education, Humanistic				Tutorial. | Liberal arts education.

Indeed, do humans covet freedom at all, or do they, as Dostoevsky has the Grand Inquisitor say, prefer to abandon their freedom in favor of happiness? From numerous perspectives, both classical and modern, this tutorial will examine freedom and itslimitations. We will consider how dystopian fiction, religious discipline, slave narratives, Nazi culture, neuroscience, and molecular biology, among others, contribute to our understandings of freedom and its boundaries, and what these understandings mean for a liberally educated person."	2003				Grinnell College							Freedom | Dystopias | Humanity in literature				Tutorial.

Through exercises in writing, spoken presentation, and discussion we shall study and analyze various aspects of five epic poems, in particular the portrayals of the hero(in)es and conceptions of the heroic in four (very) different cultures. Among topics to be addressed are the narrative patterns of quest and journey (spatial and spiritual), the role of religion and the divine, the role of women, and the diverse cultural value systems reflected in the poems. Particular attention will be paid to the organization of papers and the effective expression of ideas in writing.	2003				Grinnell College							Heroines in literature. | Epic poetry				Tutorial.
