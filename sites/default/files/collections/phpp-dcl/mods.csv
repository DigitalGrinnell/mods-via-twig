Accompanying the story of their adventures are colored photographs of the “real” Peter and Polly, who were the pets of nature photographer Cornelia Clarke.  As a young girl, Clarke, who grew up on a farm outside of Grinnell, taught herself the photographic arts by taking pictures of her cats with her father’s camera.  These photographs, which were originally in black and white, represent her early work.   Original plate-glass negatives for six of the twenty-four photographs in Peter and Polly are in the Archives at Drake Community Library. Another original glass-plate negative of a photograph in Peter and Polly is housed in the Grinnell Historical Museum.  Clarke was a premier nature photographer, well-known for her exquisite photographs of plants, insects, and animals, which were published both nationally and internationally.
