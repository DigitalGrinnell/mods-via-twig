Ruby Rich to describe a cycle of films.	2012			2012-03	Grinnell College		In 1992, B. Ruby Rich coined the term New Queer Cinema to describe a cycle of films in the late 1980s and early 1990s that broke with conventional cinematic practices to show rethought subjectivities, generic subversions, and revised histories. New Queer Cinema, however, saw little of the same bursts of innovative directors and their films after 1992. This lag in revolutionary filmmaking left many evaluating queer cinema’s current state, even mourning the supposed end of New Queer Cinema. In this paper, I argue that queer filmmaking is not void of revolutionary potential; it is more that the driving force behind these films has changed. Instead of acting in opposition to a conservative government that failed to respond to the AIDS crisis, current queer work resists the normalizing effects of today’s neoliberal government. A cycle study of recent queer films reveals this driving revolutionary force. ~ description					Queer theory | Film criticism | Neoliberalism | AIDS (Disease)				Assimilation | New Queer Cinema | AIDS crisis | Queer theory | Antisociality		Digital Grinnell ~ host | Liberal Arts Scholarly Repository ~ host | Student Scholarship ~ host	text	research paper	10 p.	pdf, doc	application/pdf	born digital	PN ~ lcc	English ~ eng	grinnell:10510	http://hdl.handle.net/11084/10510			Copyright to this work is held by the author(s), in accordance with United States copyright law (USC 17).

I look to feminist historiography as a way of countering the masculinist, institutionalized scientific discourses that have been used to define eating disorders like anorexia and bulimia. Limited conceptions of eating disorders that focus on individual deviation deny the multivalency and complexity of disorder eating. Using my own experiences as a starting point, I historically map eating disorders within their cultural contexts to demonstrate that temporally specific discursive practices shape anorexia, bulimia, and other disorders not otherwise specified. Understanding eating disorders as shaped by structural forces opens up possibilities for new types of eating disorder treatment that do not construct eating disorders as private, secretive issues but make them an issue for public concern and discussion. Eating disorders are a collective problem with a collective history(ies); we need collective solutions that address each person’s own participation/implication in the sociocultural discourses that create eating disorders. ~ description					Anorexia nervosa | Eating disorders | Sociological aspects | Bulimia				Frederick Baumann Essay Prize (2012)		Frederick Baumann Essay Prize ~ host | Digital Grinnell ~ host | Student Scholarship ~ host		research paper	26 pages		application/pdf	born digital	RC552.E18 ~ lcc	English ~ eng	grinnell:110	http://hdl.handle.net/11084/110			Copyright to this work is held by the author(s), in accordance with United States copyright law (USC 17).

Vanessa ~ advisor		This paper examines Diego Velázquez's portraits of Margarita Teresa and Baltasar Carlos to achieve an understanding of the children¹s political and gendered identities.	2014			2014-12-18	Grinnell College		This paper examines Diego Velázquez's portraits of Margarita Teresa and Baltasar Carlos to achieve an understanding of the children¹s political and gendered identities. I first turned to primary documents to understand Velázquez¹s general role at court. I then examined secondary literature to investigate the distinctive qualities of and perspectives on childhood in seventeenth century Spanish court and how they developed with the age of the child. During the reign of King Philip IV, Spanish imperial portraiture glorified the royal children as promises for the future success of the empire. I closely examined two portraits of each child, focusing on their clothing, posture, accompanying props, and setting. Although Velázquez subtly represents the gender and power differences between the two children from their first portraits at age two, he polarizes these distinctions as they age, representing Baltasar Carlos as increasingly active and masculine and representing Margarita Teresa as increasingly feminine and ready for marriage by the age of five. ~ description					Art critism | Gender identity in art | Velázquez, Diego, 1599-1660 | Portrait painting | Kings and rulers | Children		Spain	17th century				text	research paper	14 pages		application/pdf	reformated digital		English ~ eng	grinnell:11383	http://hdl.handle.net/11084/11383			Copyright to this work is held by the author(s), in accordance with United            States copyright law (USC 17).

Unlike its Lutheran-majority Baltic neighbors, Estonia and Latvia, religion remained a visible part of Lithuania’s national rhetoric, with the Catholic church eventually helping to spawn an active dissident movement and later assisting with Lithuania’s movement for independence. This project seeks to understand the shifting relationship between the KGB and the Church throughout the Soviet period, using Russian-language KGB archive documents and English translations of the Lithuanian Catholic Church's illegal dissident publication to understand how these two opposing groups coexisted and communicated with one another. I argue that while the KGB succeeding in controlling the official institutional apparatus of the Lithuanian Catholic Church, its failure to prevent non-official manifestations of Catholic belief paved the way for the eventual formation of a nationalist Catholic dissident movement in Lithuania ~ description					History | Catholic Church | Soviet Union.

Political Science Department. ~ supporting host	Explores issues with the regulation of internet providers as common carriers by the Federal Communications Commission.	2015			2015-02-16	Grinnell College		Since the 1600s, legal experts have defined common carriers as commercial services with important private and public roles, requiring government regulation to ensure equal treatment of customers. Today, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulates some, but not all, Internet service providers as common carriers, a legal classification that ensures net neutrality, an important protection for Internet content companies and consumers. However, the FCC has struggled to enforce net neutrality, because the FCC’s poor classification decisions have conflicted with the FCC’s statutorily mandated powers. First, this paper examines the quirky historical development of common carrier status. Second, this paper argues that Congress’s circular language in the Communications Act of 1934 has been the greatest obstacle to the successful enforcement of net neutrality. To prevent future regulatory struggles over this vital consumer protection, this paper concludes that two solutions offer the best long-term hope for securing net neutrality: a legislative update of the common carrier classification in the Communications Act of 1934 and or a First Amendment legal campaign against content blocking and discrimination on the Internet. ~ description					Communications Act of 1934 | Carriers | Network neutrality | Telecommunication policy | United States.

Joseph (Joe) | Maloney | Maloney, Joseph ~ creator | William (Bill) D. | Ferguson | Ferguson, William D. ~ advisor		Exploration of the Catholic Church’s promotional ladder how its level of theological flexibility effect the ability to adjust to changing market conditions.	2010				Grinnell College		Although economists in recent years have begun to apply economic theory to the activities of religious organizations, very few have ventured deeply into the realm of the Roman Catholic Church and almost none have considered the confluence between Internal Labor Market Theory and the promotional job ladder for ordained Catholic clergyman. This analysis explores the implications of the Catholic Church’s internal promotional ladder on its level of theological flexibility and hence its ability to adjust to changing market conditions. Specifically, by treating the Catholic Church as an organization subject to many of the same market forces as ordinary business firms, the research presented in this analysis shows how much of the “crisis” the church is confronting in the modern era—such as the rapid decline in the number of priests—can be explained by microeconomic structures that have developed over the past two millennia. At the broadest level, this analysis offers a new paradigm for viewing resistance to change in the church and provides a model for understanding the long-term implications of inflexibility on the viability of the church as an institution. ~ description					Supply and demand | Catholic Church | Labor market						Frederick Baumann Essay Prize ~ host | Liberal Arts Scholarly Repository ~ host | Digital Grinnell ~ host	text	research paper						English ~ eng	grinnell:113	http://hdl.handle.net/11084/113			Copyright to this work is held by the author(s), in accordance with United States copyright law (USC 17).

Moreover, all of these districts are located in communities that are home to slaughterhouses; changes in the meatpacking industry have brought many Hispanic families to these communities. Both qualitative and quantitative data was gathered including observations, interviews, enrollment, and achievement figures. This study found the presence of an achievement gap, variation in LEP/ELL programs, occurrence of white flight, and great deal of power held by the slaughterhouses in these districts. However, the fact that these districts continue to become more majority-minority, in essence segregated, is the most pressing issue found in these districts. I then discuss the implications of this segregation and review the policy options available to address it. I recommend a hybrid option of forced consolidation with community schools. ~ description					Meat industry and trade | Rural schools | Centralization		Iowa				Liberal Arts Scholarly Repository ~ host | Digital Grinnell ~ host | Mentored Advanced Project ~ host | Student Scholarship ~ host	text	research paper	46 pages		application/pdf	born digital		English ~ eng	grinnell:121	http://hdl.handle.net/11084/121			Copyright to this work is held by the author(s), in accordance with United States copyright law (USC 17).

The return of company towns occurred because of a market climate that made their monopsony position in these communities attractive to firms, and these firms exhibit many of the same exploitative and thus, problematic traits as the historic company towns of previous eras. This paper concludes by discussing the policy implications and options for addressing this market failure. It is recommended that the federal government raise the minimum wage for those employed in the meatpacking industry. ~ description					Meat industry and trade | Small cities		Iowa				Digital Grinnell ~ host | Mentored Advanced Project ~ host | Student Scholarship ~ host	text	research paper	31 pages		application/pdf	born digital		English ~ eng	grinnell:122	http://hdl.handle.net/11084/122			Copyright to this work is held by the author(s), in accordance with United States copyright law (USC 17).

By allowing for labor force growth, productivity growth, and capital accumulation the model describes the changes that need to happen to maintain equilibrium in the Honduran economy over the course of 10 years. The first set of simulations consists of a 50% increase in the international export prices of cagex (palm oil, sugarcane, bananas, shrimp, fish and other seafood, and vegetables), ccoff (coffee berries and beans), and cpfood (processed food products such as beef, sugar, rice, tobacco, alcohol, flour, beef, etc) and a 50% increase in the import prices of cchem (oil) and cagric (corn, beans, cereal, unprocessed tobacco and tobacco leaves, and wood derivatives). All else equal, average GDP growth is higher by .09, .04, and .04 percentage points each year due to the rise in the export prices of cagex, cpfood, and ccoff. The benefits are small because higher export prices increase the value of the currency, thereby lowering the international competitiveness of other export sectors. The textile sector, which constitutes nearly half of total exports, is damaged the most. When the international import prices of cagric and cchem are increased by 50%, average GDP growth is annually lower by .04 and .37 percentage points. ~ description					Economic aspects | Commodity exchanges | Commodity control | Agriculture		Honduras				Digital Grinnell ~ host | Mentored Advanced Project ~ host | Student Scholarship ~ host	text	research paper						English ~ eng	grinnell:123	http://hdl.handle.net/11084/123			Copyright to this work is held by the author(s), in accordance with United States copyright law (USC 17).

Most recently, under the presidencies of Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev, Russian foreign policy entered a period of renewed assertiveness, growing disagreement with the West, and closer formal ties to China. At the same time, the world and its politics have changed considerably, as well. Even before the epic financial crisis of 2008 crippled the economies and tarnished the apparent invincibility of the Western powers, the world began to sense that the United States and the broader West had slipped into the incipient stages of decline from global prominence. By the middle of the last decade, American hegemony no longer seemed quite as inevitable, insurmountable, or indefinite, while China’s rise became more inescapable and more breathtaking. Against the backdrop of these changes in Russian foreign policy and the international environment, this paper considers how the Russian people feel about the world around them and about the two most significant actors in it (the United States and China). ~ description					Foreign relations		Russia (Federation) | China | United States	20th century	public opinion		Digital Grinnell ~ host | Mentored Advanced Project ~ host | Student Scholarship ~ host	text	research paper	34 p.		application/pdf	born digital		English ~ eng	grinnell:124	http://hdl.handle.net/11084/124			Copyright to this work is held by the author(s), in accordance with United States copyright law (USC 17).

due to time constraints, the researchers limited the scope of the project to just those to questioning that lie within Grinnell’s city limits. Researchers identified the following as the primary food assistance resources for Grinnell residents: MICA, Food Recovery Network (FRN), Giving Gardens (Gardens), Community Meal, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (federal food stamps, or SNAP), Bountiful Baskets, Grinnell FoodShare, and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC).

Religious Studies Department. ~ supporting host	Explores how the Hong Kongese blended ancestor worship into Christianity making the two compatible for individuals.	2016				Grinnell College		As happens so often in history, cultures and religions collide and become inevitably intertwined. Hong Kong was no exception and served as a religious melting pot combining elements from both the east and west. Following the First Opium War and British occupation of Hong Kong, Christianity gained a strong foothold within the region. However, Christianity's increasing popularity did not result in a decrease in popularity in the folk religions of Hong Kong, including ancestor worship. Because Christianity did not displace ancestor worship, religious plurality is a topic of contention for many Christian religious authorities who regard certain aspects of ancestor worship, including worship of ancestors and the potential “superstitious” meanings behind certain practices, as incompatible with Christianity. Thus, many Hong Kongese have struggled to relinquish ancestor worship traditions that date back centuries while attempting to be devout Christians. However, my own upbringing and my father’s seamless integration of ancestor worship with Christianity made me wonder whether or not these two religions needed to be practiced exclusively. By consulting various religious authorities’ texts, both historical and modern-day, I found that there are a variety of methods and ways to interpret ancestor worship that allow the two to be compatible, and ultimately, the individual will need to determine the reasoning behind one’s own practices before deciding to commit faithfully to both. ~ description					Identity (Psychology) | Ancestor worship | Religious pluralism | Christianity | Buddhism		Hong Kong (China)	20th century			Digital Grinnell ~ host | Student Scholarship ~ host	text	research paper	23 pages		application/pdf	reformated digital	BL ~ lcc	English ~ eng	grinnell:13174	http://hdl.handle.net/11084/13174			Copyright to this work is held by the author(s), in accordance with United            States copyright law (USC 17).

Art and Art History Department. ~ supporting host	The photographer Carrie Mae Weems creates narratives which bring marginalized people into the center of focus. Weems mobilizes herself as artist and as subject in order to engage with issues much larger than herself.	2016			2016-05-08	Grinnell College		"Final paper for the Art History Course ""Art Since 1945"" ~ description | Throughout her career, the photographer Carrie Mae Weems has used the medium to create narratives which bring marginalized people into the center of focus. Often using her own body as the subject, she works to reconfigure the historically determined power structures that objectify or erase the experiences of African American women. In this way, Weems mobilizes herself as artist and as subject in order to engage with issues much larger than herself. Her work ""Untitled (Kitchen Table Series)"" offers a powerful study of the way in which photography, self-portraiture, and self-presentation provide paths for confusing and subverting dominant cultural narratives. This essay asserts that Weems’s photographs work against masculinist and racist modes of spectatorship through their assertion of black women as subjects, producers, makers of art and of their own representation. Moreover, Weems interrupts modes of spectatorship which normally allow these representations to go unquestioned by inviting intimacy between the viewer and the subjects of the photographs while simultaneously creating spectatorial distance through an emphasis on the constructedness of cultural narratives. This structure forces the viewer to situate themselves as subject and perpetuator of such narratives, and thus works to reconfigure racist and sexist modes of spectatorship. ~ description"					African American photographers. | Weems, Carrie Mae, 1953-		United States.	20th century			Digital Grinnell ~ host | Student Scholarship ~ host | Undergraduate Student Symposium ~ host	text	research paper	12 pages		application/pdf	reformated digital	TR ~ lcc	English ~ eng	grinnell:13257	http://hdl.handle.net/11084/13257			Copyright to this work is held by the author(s), in accordance with United            States copyright law (USC 17).

Biology Department. ~ supporting host	Explores surface runoff  as it has been increasing in quantity and decreasing in quality as more land is converted into impermeable surface.	2016			2016-04-28	Grinnell College		"Surface runoff has been increasing in quantity and decreasing in quality as more land is converted into impermeable surface. The consequences of which are increased hazards and severity of flooding, danger around waterways, and health issues to communities downstream. Management of stormwater with conservation practices can reduce runoff volume, speed, and pollution, which can mitigate the consequences of urbanization. Such practices include the use of greenroofs, permeable pavement, and rain gardens. While such practices have been shown to be effective, prohibitive costs and negative public opinion can stop such actions before they start.

In our study, we researched the potential for these practices to be included on Grinnell College’s campus. To do so, we interviewed key stakeholders, reviewed literature, measured the widths of local streams, and conducted a pilot survey on landscape opinions. We found that local streams have widened compared to historical measures, suggesting that practices could benefit Grinnell. However based on the pilot survey, if these practices are to be used, they have to overcome preconceptions about native plants. Residents look for connection to the landscape and thus need to be provided welcoming spaces to engage with the outdoors. Furthermore, education will play a key part in helping residents understand the purpose of any changes and new practices. If these new practices can gain some educational backing and be maintained properly to prevent weedy appearances, these practices could successfully be implemented on Grinnell College’s campus. ~ description"					Natural landscaping. | Grinnell College. | Runoff. | Stormwater infiltration | Sustainability.

Medical students are trained in a way that limits their creativity and emotional development, resulting in doctors who are technically skilled but lack an understanding of developing rapport through interpersonal communication. The “Medical Humanities” however, bridge this gap. The Medical Humanities focus on teaching skills through art and the social sciences, which help address the inherently subjective – but often overlooked - aspect of medicine. Ambiguity is typically not accounted for in the medical field, and therefore doctors do not know how to properly relieve situations of emotional or psychological tension; doing so, however, has shown marked improvements in patient outcome and physician satisfaction. Incorporation of arts and humanities into the curriculum for medical school students aims at preventing burnout, improving patient-physician communication, and facilitating treatment intervention strategies in a way that the current medical model lacks. ~ description					Medicine in art. | Medicine. | Science. | Study and teaching. | Science and the humanities. | Interdisciplinary approach to knowledge. | Narrative therapy. | Empathy. | Public Health.

We define the transformation by an element of the set consisting of a rotation matrix which is a continuous function of x and t, a linear transformation function of x and t, and a constant time translation. The set of these transformation elements has the structure of an infinite dimensional semi-group. This semi-group is a generalization of the Galilean line group discussed in [1]. We prove the properties of this semi-group. We calculate the Ricci tensor for this Newtownian spacetime. We calculate the coefficients in the transformed autoparallel equation, and show all three terms, including the term quadratic in the velocity, are nonzero in the general case. We show how these terms simplify to the autoparallel terms from the previous paper[1] in the case of no spatial dependence. ~ description					Space and time. | Gravity. | Modeling.

I identified possible barriers that clients could face both externally and internally. I also adapted from the USDA’s module for measuring food security, questions that measure food security, these combined with questions about specific barriers were developed into a survey for the food pantry clients of the Mid-Iowa Community Action Center. I used two levels of food security, level 1 meaning more food secure and level 2 meaning less food secure, I cross tabulated and completed a chi-square test for each of these relative measurements of food security with each barrier: transportation, food preparation knowledge, access to food appliances, availability of bread and milk programs, and food choice. Many rural pantry clients face different barriers than that of an urban client, so it was not surprising that I found the most significant barrier was an external one, transportation. The next most significant barrier was an internal one, the availability of milk vouchers. As MICA transitions into a food choice pantry and adjusts the voucher programs, the information gathered from the survey will give voice to the clients about the barriers they are experiencing. ~ description					Rural population. | Food security. | Food supply.

Disparities in access to care are greatly amplified in a developing country like Nepal due to social factors such as gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic background; however, disparities in access to living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) have not been reported since its establishment in Nepal. We analyzed retrospective data from one of the two active transplant centers in Nepal to assess factors that affect access to LDKT. Demographics of 137 kidney transplant recipients and their donors were compared to demographics for the general population of Nepal as ascertained from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). Men comprised 82% of the recipients but only 30% of the donors. There is a higher proportion of 'higher castes' (Chhetris and Newars) in the transplant cohort compared to the general population. The central region and adjoining regions are disproportionately represented among recipients. Socially marginalized groups such as women and lower caste groups are underrepresented in the transplant cohort. Similarly, patients farther from the transplant centers, both of which are in central Nepal, are also underrepresented in the transplant cohort. ~ description					Kidney transplantation | Health services accessibility | Organ donors | Transplantation of organs, tissues, etc.		Nepal	Two thousand tens			Digital Grinnell ~ host | Mentored Advanced Project ~ host | Student Scholarship ~ host	text	poster	1 sheet		application/pdf	reformated digital	HC79.P6 ~ lcc	English ~ eng	grinnell:18504	http://hdl.handle.net/11084/18504			Copyright to this work is held by the author(s), in accordance with United            States copyright law (USC 17).

Anthropology Department. ~ supporting host	Poland and Ireland each have some of the world's most restrictive abortion legislation, with abortion being nearly if not entirely criminalized in both countries. The Catholic Church filled a nationalist role, setting the stage for each country to become a modern theocracy.	2017				Grinnell College		Research paper developed for a Mentored Advanced Project in Anthropology with Professor Brigittine French and presented at the 2017 Research, Scholarship and Creative Activity Symposium. ~ note | Poland and Ireland each have some of the world's most restrictive abortion legislation, with abortion being nearly if not entirely criminalized in both countries. Their respective histories provided an ideological vacuum in which the Catholic Church filled a nationalist role, setting the stage for each country to become a modern theocracy. Both countries have a strong tendency to equate nationalism with Catholicism, and further, with traditional gender roles; this emphasis on gendered nationalism becomes a mechanism through which the male, Catholic nation-state maintains control over women. The influence of the church-state strips women of their physical, intellectual, and political agency. Restrictive abortion legislation in Ireland and Poland is an embodiment of Catholic influences and biopolitics. The state's management and control of reproduction are inseparable from how women's bodies and lives are managed and controlled. Gendered understandings of the nation are manifested at the site of the female body vis-á-vis the state's policies, and abortion access therefore becomes explicitly linked to the moral and political boundaries of the nation. I argue that the nationalist, religious rhetoric employed by the unofficial theocracy in both states coupled with a historical legacy of conservative understandings of gender enable Ireland and Poland to implicitly and explicitly deprive women of their fundamental rights; as such, women are subject to processes of regulation, discipline, and control carried out by the Irish and Polish Catholic nation-states. Both states thereby institutionalize policies and ideologies that systematically oppress women and hierarchize fetal life over the lives of women. ~ description					Abortion. | Biopolotocs/ | Nationalism. | Women in the Catholic Church. | Reproductive rights.

History Department. ~ supporting host	Project examining how Grinnell, Iowa remembered its Civil War veterans, through the content and language of obituaries written in the Grinnell Herald.	2016				Grinnell College		Final group project for HIS 214 American Civil War & Reconstruction which was presented at the 2017 Research, Scholarship and Creative Activity Symposium. ~ note | Our project examines how Grinnell, Iowa remembered its Civil War veterans, specifically through the content and language of obituaries written in one of Poweshiek County’s most widely read newspapers, the Grinnell Herald. Through critical examination and content analysis of these obituaries, we can discern, through the public nature of this type of commemoration, the process of mourning in Grinnell, what kind of model life and values were conveyed and what about the war was deemed worthy of being remembered or forgotten. In short, we can determine what particular value was placed on each of these men’s lives. Situated within processes of mourning and remembrance occurring nationwide (in particular touching on the scholarly debate between David Blight and Caroline Janney over how reunion and reconciliation transpired along racial lines), this analysis seeks to establish the way conceptions of value, race, and identity were formulated in Civil War veteran memory and perpetuated on a local level. Although Grinnell’s memory of the Civil War strongly vindicates the Union cause and cherishes the legacy of emancipation, the obituaries use veteran status in a way that supports white supremacy by conceding to a racial conception of citizenship and value in society, a conception that was used to unite the town in times of trouble and upheaval yet carried a racial cost. Grinnell’s experience offers insights into how memory played out elsewhere, demonstrating that even in the context of a strong emancipationist memory, the accommodation of white hegemony can contribute to racial erasure. ~ description					Social status. | Civil War, 1861-1865. | Social conditions. | Obituaries.

This paper investigates the case study of COOK, a popular Argentine clothing company that prominently features the Confederate flag in its logo and branding.	2016				Grinnell College		This work was originally created as a paper for Professor Purcell's History seminar (HIS-314) and presented at the 2017 Research, Scholarship and Creative Activity Symposium. ~ note | While both the original meaning and contemporary invocations of the American Confederate flag unequivocally represent racism and white supremacy, the emblem is not a universally condemned symbol, but merely a polarizing one in the United States. The recent globalization of fashion has transmitted not only the American Confederate flag to other countries, but also the debate surrounding its place in popular culture. This paper investigates the case study of COOK, a popular Argentine clothing company that prominently features the Confederate flag in its logo and branding. While American clothing companies that brandish the flag often recall a glorified past and an emphasis on the heritage of the flag, COOK and many of its customers expressly ignore the history behind one of the most historically significant symbols of all time. This paper ultimately grapples with the irony of the symbol’s popularity within Argentina, a country plagued by a history of human rights violations and racism. ~ description					Fashion. | Civil War, 1861-1865. | Flags. | Confederate States of America. | Clothing and dress. | Globalization.

The conclusion of the Civil War was supposed to ensure both a de jure and de facto expansion of what it meant to be black in the U.S. context. Yet white civil society responded the death of slavery through the practice of lynching. Often read as an intimate, communitary, and deeply erotic social phenomena, lynching is often deployed in the context of building blackness as monstrosity, emasculating the black phallus, and protecting white female purity. In the short story ""Going to Meet the Man,"" James Baldwin provides a necessary, though oft-ignored, meditation on the deep homoeroticism and fantasy of lynching for white male authority. Written in the context of burgeoning Black Power and the Civil Rights movement, I argue that Baldwin's work builds a channel between the lynching practices of the postbellum South with the violence of the modern police state, all the while expanding narratives of lynching into deeply homoerotic space, in turn providing both a corrective and new perspective on the way in which we read lynching as well as confronting white authority with its laden homosociality. In turn, we must pause at this new conception of white civil society and the often obscured territories of deeply subconscious desires for black male flesh, as Baldwin's work taps into a reconceptualization of the turn from slave to free black that passes from an issue of political economy to one of libido and rampant accumulation and consumption. ~ description"					Short stories, American. | Baldwin, James, 1841-1925. | Critical theory. | Literary theory.

McIntyre. ~ note | For me, I Must Be Sure represents the culmination of my studies in music composition throughout my time at Grinnell, marking my first serious excursion into writing a piece for orchestra. I had written works for smaller chamber ensembles before, but I was initially overwhelmed by the sheer size of the orchestra. Because of the massive scope of the project, I struggled with writer’s block, not knowing how to best dive into composing for the GSO. Many different ideas came and went, but nothing quite seemed to work. Eventually, I stumbled upon the Beatles song, If I Fell, which was one of my favorites as a kid. As I listened to the song, I was very moved by its themes of struggle and indecision—themes that applied to my current struggle with my orchestra piece. To me, If I Fell explores the difficulty of making a decision, not quite knowing what the implications of that decision may be. Compositions are written by making a thousand little (but always important) decisions—which note, which harmony, which rhythm, which instrument—these and countless other elements have to be chosen in order to write a composition. Since I related so strongly to these themes, I decided to use melodic fragments from the original Beatles song as a framework for my own piece. In many ways, I Must Be Sure (a line from the Beatles song), is a retelling of If I Fell, except that, rather than detailing the struggles with a romantic relationship, my work looks into the struggles with creating a piece of music. This idea is evident in the accelerating rhythms and complex textures in the piece. Towards the end, there is some notion of triumph over this struggle, a sense of overcoming; but, in the piece’s final section, with the rising melodic motif, the narrative seems to question itself again, perhaps admitting that nothing is ever truly certain, and that the struggle with decision/indecision, especially within a creative context, is a fundamental part of the artistic process. ~ description					Scores. | Orchestral music.

Created for Religion 295: Empire and Religion in Asia and the Pacific with Professor Amy Holmes-Tagchungdarpa ~ note | During the Second World War, over 110,000 people of Japanese descent living on the Pacific Coast were removed from their homes and relocated into internment camps. Within the camps, the Nikkei (Japanese people) worked to establish any semblance of normalcy in their lives. This research paper is a study of how Japanese Americans sought to build a sense of community within the bounds of the camps. Some did turn to faith, but many simply participated in religious activity to retain a sense of community. This is complicated by the fact that within Japanese American culture, religion is embedded within culture. No matter their religious beliefs, by participating in cultural events, Japanese Americans are taking part in a faith-based activity. While religion was an important aspect of the internment experience, sports and other social activities were as equally important. In this time of extreme stress, Japanese Americans wholeheartedly embraced sports, clubs, and groups. On Sunday mornings, some preferred to be at the baseball diamond rather than at church. No matter what they turned to for comfort, the Japanese Americans needed a strong community to withstand the psychological stress that incarceration caused. ~ description					Cultural assimilation. | Japanese Americans. | Evaculation and relocation, 1942-1945. | World War, 1939-1945. | Concentration camps. | Religious aspects. | Americanization.

This division is reinforced through first world entertainment and prevents spectators from perceiving indigenous people outside of a colonizing gaze. In this paper, I examine how first world films provide the spectator with false feelings of utopia by obscuring the violent relationship between capitalism and colonization. As an example of a film that subverts this model, I turn to Jorge Furtado's Isle of Flowers (1989), which works to reconstruct the spectator's perception of different subjects in the third world through a postcolonial framework. The film’s awareness of confliction between Portuguese colonizers and the indigenous people of Brazil introduces spectators to the convoluted history associated with colonization. Isle of Flowers begins to work at deconstructing what first world entertainment supports; instead of concealing these issue, spectators intervene through the eye of the camera. Postcolonial framework becomes the necessary tool Isle of Flowers applies to remodel how spectators view the third world. I contend since third world production techniques are distinct from the first world, Isle of Flowers functions as a strong example of third cinema, a democratizing piece that allows spectators to have a new perspective. ~ description					Documentary films. | Ilha das flores.

While the farmers take care of the livestock, large corporations control production at these operations (Wing 2002). It is of increasing interest to local communities and environmental activists to understand how citizens are being affected by this farming technique and the conflict it creates between communities and farmers. In response to the lack of multiplicity of perspectives in literature the purpose of this study is to examine the beliefs and experiences of the residents of Poweshiek and neighboring counties pertaining to CAFOs, to determine how people feel about them and what they perceive to be the source of conflict. This research found that in condensing a multiplicity of experiences and perspectives into one conversation about agriculture it becomes apparent that people are approaching this issue with a premeditated combativeness and that each issue inherent to industrial agricultural production, though it creates different opinions and experiences, could be alleviated with more frank and generous communication. Livestock production is personal, often tied closely with ideals of heritage, livelihood, and property rights, and this shared relationship with agricultural actually unites all those involved in this conflict. ~ description					Agriculture. | Factory farms | Animal industry | Meat industry and trade | Environmental Sciences.

As a religious studies major I have spent a lot of time considering the different religious traditions around the world and how they each have occupied and traversed the globe, specifically spending a lot of my studies learning about religion in the history and public sphere of Asia, but I have spent very little time studying religion in America. This project gave me the opportunity to unpack the ways that religion exists in American public life and allowed me to examine the ways in which dominant publics in the U.S, like the secular and liberal public we participate in at Grinnell College, create conditional participation for certain identities like Muslim Americans. ~ description					Muslims. | Islamophobia. | Muslims in public life. | Intellectuals. | Citizen participation.

E. ~ creator	Grinnell College. Sociology Department. ~ supporting host	Paper exploring the decisions that these children of Korean immigrants make to gain membership in either Korean or American communities.	2017	2017-05-20			Grinnell College		According to a recent Pew study, Korean Americans are most likely to have a majority, if not all of their friends from the same ethnic heritage, when compared to other U.S. Asian groups. What explains their preference for ethnically homogenous social networks? The existing studies on Korean American acculturation focus on the first generation immigrants and the role of religion and churches in these communities, but research on other aspects of the Korean community in the United States has been neglected. This project shifts the focus away from traditional research on first-generation Koreans’ affinity with the church and instead highlights the implications of their homogenous social relationships on our understanding of race and ethnicity in the U.S, with a particular focus on young Korean-Americans. Through in-depth interviews with six second-generation Korean Americans in the Seattle area, this research offers a deeper understanding of the decisions that these children of immigrants make to gain membership in either Korean or American communities. More specifically, the interviews reveal the work involved with and reward received through selective ethnic relationships, and the limited but strategic “option” of adopting or accentuating one’s Koreanness. My findings suggest that second-generation Korean Americans’ ethnic identity management entails both burdensome labor and calls for a redefinition of Americanness. ~ description					Children of immigrants. | Korean Americans | Cultural assimilation. | Americanization, | Assimilation (Sociology).

    whether the legalization of abortion in 1920 had any real impact on the lives of Russian
    women."	2016				Grinnell College		"Developed for History 100-03, submitted on 20 May 2016 to Professor Kelly
    Maynard. ~ note | I began this project as an analysis of Bolshevik Feminism and its
    interaction with Socialist ideologies during the Bolshevik Revolution. In a book about European
    women’s movements, I discovered that in 1920, Russia had become the first nation to legalize
    abortion. With my knowledge of feminist history, I was quite shocked to come upon this fact. I
    decided this would be a perfectly narrowed topic with which to begin my project. After reading
    secondary literature on the topic, I developed my primary question: was this legislation
    revolutionary for the women it affected? Was it revolutionary in its political context? The
    secondary literature available had not answered this question directly, so I pieced together
    various scholarly sources and four primary documents from translated Russian writers to deduce
    my conclusions.  I found that the law was an attempt at a drastic social change, but
    it ultimately did not affect the lives of Russian women as a whole. I found that abortion has
    been historically perceived as the primary form of birth control in Russia, so the only way for
    it to disappear would be mass education on other forms of contraception. Whether the practice
    was legal or illegal, its frequency did not change. This legislation was politically
    revolutionary, albeit merely in the sense that its condition ended in the way it began: abortion
    was made illegal less than twenty years after its legalization. ~ description"					Abortion. | Women. | Birth control.		Russia. | Soviet Union.	Nineteen thirties. | Nineteen twenties.

    hyphenated identity as a strategy of becoming an American."	2017				Grinnell College		"In the early 1900s, there was an influx of immigrants to the United
    States with numbers surpassing twenty million. All of a sudden pockets of immigrants of Eastern
    European and Mediterranean descent emerged across the United States. This influx of immigration
    was contextualized as a challenge to the state’s efforts in building a nation-state. So how does
    the state adopt to the rapid demographic changes to secure its survival and forge the loyalty of
    the newcomers? The scope of this paper will discuss Mary Antin’s memoir, The Promised Land, to
    investigate why the state allows for a hyphenated identity as a strategy of securing its
    survival. It addresses the cultural, political, and the societal implications of the project of
    Americanization and the construction of an American identity. Antin goes through the process of
    Americanization and successfully becomes an American—a Jewish-American. Although she does not
    have to give up her Jewishness to become an American, the terms of what constitutes “Jewishness”
    get redefined by the state. The state has an interest in destroying the otherness and melting
    the pot. Therefore, it allows but renegotiates the hyphenated identity, treating the hyphen as a
    transitional space in which the work of cultural ideology is done. So, to become an American,
    Antin feels that first she has to change her name, get rid of her accent, leave Judaism. Thus,
    the hyphen becomes a metonym for the project of Americanization. It acknowledges the existence
    of difference while aggressively undermining and eradicating the saliency of that
    difference. ~ description"					Assimilation (Sociology) | Antin, Mary, 1881-1949. | Promised Land (1912) | Jewish authors.		United States.	Nineteen tens.

We hypothesized that (a) women who received more comprehensive sex and relationship education would report fewer IPV experiences, (b) women who received their sex and relationship education from certain sources would report fewer instances of IPV, and (c) women who communicated more with partners would experience fewer instances of IPV. The study consisted of a survey completed by 48 women at a liberal arts college regarding their IPV history, sex and relationship education, and communication with partners. The first hypothesis was not supported; however, the results showed that women who did not receive their education from a medical professional and women who communicated more with their partner experienced fewer instances of IPV. These results suggest the need for additional research into types of education as tools for preventing IPV and the importance of communication within relationships. ~ description					Intimate partner violence | Women college students						Liberal Arts Scholarly Repository ~ host | Student Scholarship ~ host	text	article	6 pages		application/pdf	born digital		English ~ eng	grinnell:221	http://hdl.handle.net/11084/221			Copyright to this work is held by the author(s), in accordance with United States copyright law (USC 17).

Anthropology Department. ~ supporting host	The French language in Ferdinand Oyono’s Houseboy reveals the power struggles between the colonizers and the colonized that took place in French West Africa.	2018	2018-05-11			Grinnell College		This paper investigates the use of the French language in Ferdinand Oyono’s Houseboy and how it reveals the power struggles between the colonizers and the colonized that took place in French West Africa. The French language has played several roles in the history between Europe and Africa. It acted as a symbol of domination in the colonial period when it signified the power of the colonizers, and only a minority of Africans had the opportunity to learn French. During the fall of the French empire as decolonization was sweeping the African continent, the role of the language transformed into one of resistance as Africans proficient in the language became revolutionaries and led independence movements in their countries. In the modern world, the French language has become a symbol of collaboration as it unites France with her former African colonies through la Francophonie. Many people think of the relationship between France and West Africa as one filled with a history of abuse, oppression and even death, but these events and interpretations are a part of a much larger story. France and West Africa have evolved together with the French language acting as the primary facilitator of their exchanges. This research stresses the advantages of studying the relationship between these regions with nuance rather than through a balkanized lens that separates the two and shows one as consistently more powerful and influential than the other. A more complex view of the relationship allows for the efficient study of the several identities and trade dealings that have stemmed from centuries of collaboration between the European and African continents. ~ note					History and criticism | African literature (French) | Oyono, Ferdinand, 1929-2010.

Sociology Department. ~ supporting host	The relationship between casting and race has been insufficiently examined in both popular and academic writings on Hollywood.	2019	2019-05-15			Grinnell College		Aside from the occasional controversy, the relationship between casting and race has been insufficiently examined in both popular and academic writings on Hollywood. In this paper, I examine the narratives and discourse of Hollywood casting directors in interviews and popular media as an important missing piece from the larger discussion on race in Hollywood. In doing so, I argue that casting directors' performances as expert gatekeepers work to justify the exclusion of people of color through narratives of hard work and creativity which, following George Lipsitz, legitimize and invest in whiteness. This expert investment in whiteness, in turn, serves to reporduce the conditions necessary to justify a white-dominated film and television industry and uphold dominant ideologies of whiteness. ~ note					Whites - Race identity | Casting (Performing arts) | Motion picture industry. | Casting directors. | Television programs-Casting		Hollywood (California)		whitness | Hollywood. | media and race		Digital Grinnell ~ host | Student Scholarship ~ host | Undergraduate Student Symposium ~ host	text	research paper					PN1995.9.C34 ~ lcc	English ~ eng	grinnell:26708	http://hdl.handle.net/11084/26708			Copyright to this work is held by the author(s), in accordance with United            States copyright law (USC 17).

My goal was to bring a quality of artistic sophistication to a ritual we experience every day – consuming food off of hand-built yet functional works of art. My set includes five matching dinner plates, dessert plates, bowls, cups and mugs that were thrown using cone-10 clay. Additionally, I made two larger forms for serving food, a platter and a bowl. I believe this project produced works of art embodying craft and quality suitable to be displayed individually in a gallery. When all of the ceramic forms are brought together as a unified dinnerware set, it connects the artist's spirit with a unique dining ritual. ~ description					Pottery, American | Ceramic tableware		United States				Liberal Arts Scholarly Repository ~ host | Digital Grinnell ~ host | Student Scholarship ~ host | Mentored Advanced Project ~ host	mixed material	poster	1 sheet		application/pdf	born digital		English ~ eng	grinnell:318	http://hdl.handle.net/11084/318			Copyright to this work is held by the author(s), in accordance with United States copyright law (USC 17).

While these legacies are deeply ingrained in national thought, they have been constructed in ways that are radically different from reality. They have been appropriated, as American society has simplified, changed, or ignored the actual beliefs and actions of these assassinated figures. Case studies of Martin Luther King, Jr., Malcolm X, Abraham Lincoln, and John F. Kennedy illustrate this. The metamorphosis of legacy described here does not occur out of ignorance and is not a product of collective action. Rather, it reflects elite control in America, as a small group of individuals influence the agents of socialization associated with instilling impressions of these figures (i.e. media and school system). The implications of the elite-controlled social appropriation of legacy are discussed in the context of the implementation of democratic governance. ~ description					Elite (Social sciences) | Martyrs | Heroes | Assassination | Political aspects | Social aspects | Frederick Baumann Essay Prize (2013)		United States				Frederick Baumann Essay Prize ~ host | Digital Grinnell ~ host | Student Scholarship ~ host	text	research paper	29 pages		application/pdf	born digital		English ~ eng	grinnell:3202	http://hdl.handle.net/11084/3202			Copyright to this work is held by the author(s), in accordance with United States copyright law (USC 17).

This software was also used to present a visualization showing how channelization has stopped the natural variation in the river paths. The total length of the channels is used to indicate how much they have been straightened. Results show that the combined length of both branches is 42.6 miles shorter now than it was in the mid 1800s. ~ description					River channels -- Iowa -- Skunk River | Skunk River (Iowa) | River engineering -- Iowa -- Skunk River			1832 | 2004			Digital Grinnell ~ host | Liberal Arts Scholarly Repository ~ host	mixed material	report				born digital		English ~ eng	grinnell:3416	http://hdl.handle.net/11084/3416			Copyright to this work is held by the author(s), in accordance with United States copyright law (USC 17).

Ruby Rich coined the term New Queer Cinema to describe a cycle of films in the late 1980s and early 1990s that broke with conventional cinematic practices to show rethought subjectivities, generic subversions, and revised histories. New Queer Cinema, however, saw little of the same bursts of innovative directors and their films after 1992. This lag in revolutionary filmmaking left many evaluating queer cinema’s current state, even mourning the supposed end of New Queer Cinema. In this paper, I argue that queer filmmaking is not void of revolutionary potential; it is more that the driving force behind these films has changed. Instead of acting in opposition to a conservative government that failed to respond to the AIDS crisis, current queer work resists the normalizing effects of today’s neoliberal government. A cycle study of recent queer films reveals this driving revolutionary force.	2012			2012-03								Queer theory | Film criticism | Neoliberalism | AIDS (Disease)				Assimilation | New Queer Cinema | AIDS crisis | Queer theory | Antisociality		Digital Grinnell ~ host | Liberal Arts Scholarly Repository ~ host	Presentation		10 p.	pdf, doc		born digital		English ~ eng	grinnell:3419	http://hdl.handle.net/11084/3419			Copyright to this work is held by the author(s), in accordance with United States copyright law (USC 17).

Facilities available to students were important to room use, and corresponded, in part, to student opinion on study preferences. While study areas separated the science majors, they did not exclude non-majors and underclassmen. In fact, more non-science-majors use study areas in Noyce than do science majors, though science majors spend more time in these. ~ description					College buildings | Grinnell (Iowa) | Robert N. Noyce '49 Science Center (Grinnell, Iowa) | College students						Digital Grinnell ~ host | Liberal Arts Scholarly Repository ~ host | Student Scholarship ~ host	text	poster	1 sheet		application/pdf	born digital		English ~ eng	grinnell:3421	http://hdl.handle.net/11084/3421			Copyright to this work is held by the author(s), in accordance with United States copyright law (USC 17).

This area is made up of a 3.5 by 5-block rectangle bordered by Park Street, 6th Avenue, West Street, and 11th Avenue (Map 1). Within these boundaries, there are 157 historic homes built between 1867 and 1958 (Map 2) in a wide assortment of architectural styles (Map 3). The district was awarded a historic designation both for its compelling built environment and its past. Its history begins in 1867, when the southern part of the neighborhood was established. Following the extensive damage of the infamous 1882 cyclone, residents rebuilt and began to settle north of 8th Avenue, on land sold by farmer and landowner George W. Merrill. Construction continued steadily in the 1890s, spurred in part by the completion of Grinnell’s municipal water system in 1894. Following the turn of the century, development spread past 10th Avenue, after Merrill had died and more of his land became available. Prominent citizens of Grinnell have chosen to reside in the area throughout its history. They originally included manufacturers, merchants, attorneys, and doctors. However, another population allowed many of them to build and maintain their elegant homes: Grinnell College student boarders. Before the construction of major dormitories in 1915 and 1917, students frequently resided with families in town, thus providing an important source of income (Jacobsen 2008). ~ description					Historic districts | Grinnell (Iowa) | Historic buildings		Grinnell (Iowa)	1860 | 1990			Digital Grinnell ~ host | Liberal Arts Scholarly Repository ~ host | Student Scholarship ~ host	text	poster	1 sheet		application/pdf	born digital		English ~ eng	grinnell:3423	http://hdl.handle.net/11084/3423			Copyright to this work is held by the author(s), in accordance with United States copyright law (USC 17).

The project focused on seven topics: environmental impact, nutrition, dining service logistics, producer logistics, economic impact, student opinion, and local foods at public schools. The study found that serving locally produced food in the Grinnell College dining halls is a viable option for the College. The purpose of this study is to provide a foundation for the understanding of the issues behind the local food situation at Grinnell and encourage the future development of this system. ~ description							Grinnell (Iowa)				Digital Grinnell ~ host	text	research paper	102 pages					English ~ eng	grinnell:3470	http://hdl.handle.net/11084/3470			Copyright to this work is held by the author(s), in accordance with United            States copyright law (USC 17).

The very secrecy and silence involved with the sex trade, however, obscures these numbers. Most likely there exist many more not included in these statistics. Sex trafficking is a prevalent, dangerous, ever-growing issue that is putting people's lives at risk. ~ description					Protocol to Prevent, Suppress, and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children | Human trafficking | Sex crimes			21st Century	Grinnell Peace Studies Student Conference 2010		Liberal Arts Scholarly Repository ~ host | Peace Studies Student Conference ~ host | Social Justice at Grinnell ~ host | Digital Grinnell ~ host	text	research paper	9 pages		application/pdf	born digital		English ~ eng	Grinnell:45	http://hdl.handle.net/11084/45			Copyright to this work is held by the author(s), in accordance with United States copyright law (USC 17).

Anthropology ~ author	This study was interesting to examine how identity is tied to place. Positioned in the minds of those that give it meaning, “sense of place issues in a stream of symbolically drawn particulars-the visible particulars of local topographies, the personal particulars of biographical associations, and the notional particulars of socially given systems of thought” (Basso 1996:144). In other words, movement within a landscape will assign meaning to different places in that area. Meaning arises from interactions with the landscape-whether it be oral traditions tied to places within a place or events that happen in a place within recent time. As identity develops around place, “without hegemony, means and meaning may never come together, landscape representation may never become a reality, and social conflict will be open as space remains contested” (Harner 2001:676) and power can be exerted through the naming of “geographical entities, most particularly over the way in which places, their inhabitants and their social functions get represented” (Harvey 1990:419).So, we began to shape our study with this in mind.	2011			2011-05-16	Grinnell College							Human geography | College Campuses | Grinnell College | Human factors		Grinnell (Iowa)				Liberal Arts Scholarly Repository ~ host | Digital Grinnell ~ host	Poster				application/pdf	born digital		English ~ eng	Grinnell:50	http://hdl.handle.net/11084/50			Copyright to this work is held by the author(s), in accordance with United States copyright law (USC 17).

They are seen as the ultimate independent agent, experiencing the freedom of complete control over their lives and succeeding based on hard work alone. However, the level of control that farmers actually have over their environment does not reflect this ideal. The industrialization of agriculture has caused conventional farmers to be highly dependent upon external organizations, whose influence has led to environmental degradation and social changes. These changes were adopted in order to gain more control over their land, but have led to conventional farmers ceding much of their feelings of freedom and autonomy. ~ description					Economic aspects | Farmers | Agriculture		United States				Digital Grinnell ~ host | Mentored Advanced Project ~ host | Student Scholarship ~ host	text	research paper	27 pages		application/pdf	born digital	S ~ lcc	English ~ eng	grinnell:5753	http://hdl.handle.net/11084/5753			Copyright to this work is held by the author(s), in accordance with United States copyright law (USC 17).
