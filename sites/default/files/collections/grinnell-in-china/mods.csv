These letters are bound together and begin with a foreword written by Alice in the 60’s. In this foreword, she describes how she came to the Grinnell in China program and the prospect of going to the “new Republic of China.” This foreword introduces Alice’s life, which after 1916 was carefully documented in her letters home. Also included are two maps at the end of the book, one of China and another of Alice's travels around the world. Alice describes her journey to China in September of 1916 after joining the Grinnell in China Mission at the age of 26. She sails first to Nagasaki in Japan and then on to Techow, China to work at the North China Anglican Mission. Alice travels throughout China, Europe, India, and Africa, all the while tracing her movements throughout the world through her letters. Her encounters with Chinese rebels, military, and communists during this tumultuous time in Chinese history are all recorded with details on the movements of the groups and their effect on the population. During the Second World War, Alice is forced to leave China for the United States in December of 1942. She eventually returns to teach at a different school in Chengtu until leaving China permanently in 1948 in response to growing unrest.  Included in her narrative are the details of her fellow missionaries as they live and work together. Alfred and Irma Heininger and their family are mentioned throughout the letters, as well as Harold and Grace Matthews. Also included are Ruth Tollman, the Miles family, Dr. Emma Tucker, the MacEachron family, the Cady family, the Robinson family, the Child family, the Arnold family, Lucy Mead, Adelle Tenney, Lucia Lyons, and a large number of other people during her 32 year stay in China.  Ms. Reed is in Techow during the Sun Yat Sen revolution, World War I, the Communist Uprising, the beginning stages of World War II, and the beginning of the Communist Revolution. Throughout all of these events, Ms. Reed teaches in two missionary schools, one in Techow and another in Chengtu. She moves to Chengtu following her return to China in 1944, once WWII permits travel to the country. As fighting comes to Techow during the Sun Yat Sen movement, the Japanese invasion, and the Communist Revolution, Reed details the efforts made by the missionaries to provide adequate medical care and shelter to the affected population. When the Japanese occupy China during the late 30’s, Reed notes the political and social changes that affect the school and her pupils.  A larger aspect of Reed’s time as a missionary was her ability to travel. Her 32-year tenure as a missionary was a unique chance for exposure to the larger world and Reed takes advantage of the Furloughs and other gaps in missionary work to travel a large portion of that world. She travels to Japan, Peitaiho, Peking, Nanking, Shanghai, Siberia, Moscow, Warsaw, Berlin, Montreaux, Interlaken, Paris, London, Liverpool, Montreal, Sumatra, Madagascar, Rio de Janeiro, Portugal, and India. As war breaks out between Japan and the United States, the Americans at the mission are sent home on a boat manned by the Japanese. This journey took the Americans through Sumatra, Java, Mozambique, and ended with the exchange of American and Japanese nationals in Rio de Janeiro. Once Alice returns in 1944, the situation in China only continues to worsen and the missionaries are unable to return to Techow due to the communist occupation. After hoping to move to Sian to teach at the Jefferson Academy, it becomes apparent that she will not be able to move there due to her status as a woman. As such, Alice begins teaching in the English Department at Cheeloo University. Many of her students in Chengtu are refugees from the Japanese, having been so anywhere from 1-7 years. As fighting between the communists and Japanese worsens, most of Shansi Province is put under Martial law. It soon becomes obvious that the communists may capture Chengtu and the American consul advises citizens in 1948 to evacuate the area. Alice Reed leaves China for the last time on November 16, 1948. She returns to the United States for two years, living in Syracuse and Oberlin, helping to care for her mother. After these two years, Reed goes to Uskudar, Turkey to teach at the American School for Girls. She returns to the United States permanently in 1959, moving to Syracuse until 1963 when she retires at the Pilgrim Place Retirement Community in Claremont, California.	1916	1966		1916-1948- Years on letters ~ Date (Other)										Dezhou Shi (China) | Beijing (China) | Forbidden City (Beijing, China) | China | Mongolia	1912-1928 | Republic, 1912-1949 | Warlord period, 1916-1928 | Movement to Protect the Constitution, 1917-1923 | Qing Dynasty Restoration Attempt, 1917 | May Fourth movement, 1919 | May Thirtieth movement, 1925 | Northern Expedition, 1926-1928 | 1928-1937 (Sino-Japanese Conflict) | 1937-1945 (Sino-Japanese War) | Civil War, 1945-1949 | Twentieth century | Nineteen tens | Nineteen twenties | Nineteen thirties | Nineteen forties	American influences | Adult education | Agricultural education | Attitudes | Basic education | Books and reading | Chinese | Chinese language | Chinese New Year | Chinese people | Chinese students | Christian education | Christianity | City missions | Classrooms | Communism | Demonstrations | Dormitories | Dormitory life | Education | Education (Elementary) | Education (Higher) | Education (Secondary) | Education of boys | Education of girls | English influences | English language | Famines | Footbinding | Missionaries | Missions | Political activity | Politics and Government | Religious aspects | Social conditions | Rural missions | Social life and customs | Social values | Travel | Palaces | Values | Parades | Political refugees | Public meetings | Public officers | Refugees | Riots | School buildings | School discipline | Shrines | Social gospel | Student strikes | Taoism | Western influences | War victims | Temples			Text	Correspondence (group of letters ingested as a compound)	258 pages						grinnell:17439	http://hdl.handle.net/11084/17439					99
