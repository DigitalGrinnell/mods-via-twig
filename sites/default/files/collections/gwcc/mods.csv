(Section 2). The sheet itself has no date, but was found in an envelope dated 28 April 1857. Note the second paragraph, which claims the college has not yet moved to Grinnell. As described in the 1860 page of the on-line history of Grinnell College, the College evidently moved to Grinnell in 1861, so that information in the letter doesn’t fix the year. Since the last paragraph appears to describe land GWC contemplates purchasing, I am guessing that 1857 may well be correct. ~ note"					Iowa College (Davenport, Iowa) | Grinnell University | Land use, Rural | Real estate business | Public land sales		Grinnell (Iowa) | Poweshiek County (Iowa) | Iowa	Eighteen fifties			Digital Grinnell ~ host | Grinnell College.
