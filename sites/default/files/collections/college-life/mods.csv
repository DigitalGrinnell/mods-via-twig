Biology Department. ~ supporting host	Explores surface runoff  as it has been increasing in quantity and decreasing in quality as more land is converted into impermeable surface.	2016			2016-04-28	Grinnell College		"Surface runoff has been increasing in quantity and decreasing in quality as more land is converted into impermeable surface. The consequences of which are increased hazards and severity of flooding, danger around waterways, and health issues to communities downstream. Management of stormwater with conservation practices can reduce runoff volume, speed, and pollution, which can mitigate the consequences of urbanization. Such practices include the use of greenroofs, permeable pavement, and rain gardens. While such practices have been shown to be effective, prohibitive costs and negative public opinion can stop such actions before they start.

In our study, we researched the potential for these practices to be included on Grinnell College’s campus. To do so, we interviewed key stakeholders, reviewed literature, measured the widths of local streams, and conducted a pilot survey on landscape opinions. We found that local streams have widened compared to historical measures, suggesting that practices could benefit Grinnell. However based on the pilot survey, if these practices are to be used, they have to overcome preconceptions about native plants. Residents look for connection to the landscape and thus need to be provided welcoming spaces to engage with the outdoors. Furthermore, education will play a key part in helping residents understand the purpose of any changes and new practices. If these new practices can gain some educational backing and be maintained properly to prevent weedy appearances, these practices could successfully be implemented on Grinnell College’s campus. ~ description"					Natural landscaping. | Grinnell College. | Runoff. | Stormwater infiltration | Sustainability.

Iowans contributed greatly to the Union War effort both on the battlefield and home front. Many men from the town of Grinnell and students from Iowa College joined the Union Army. In fact, the majority of the freshman class of 1861 left the college to go to war. This exhibit explores not only how Grinnellians engaged in the actual war, but also how they were involved in the debate over slavery before the war and how they commemorated veterans after the War. ~ description					Mentored Advanced Project						Digital Grinnell ~ host | Library Exhibitions ~ host	text	book	19 pages		image/tiff	born digital		English ~ eng	grinnell:3061	http://hdl.handle.net/11084/3061			Copyright to this work is held by the author(s), in accordance with United States copyright law (USC 17).

Do we need political parties? Should the death penalty be abolished? For over 60 years, Grinnell College’s Literary Societies met to dance, converse, and hold forth on issues that are still pertinent in the 21st century. These groups were the beginning of a tradition that carries on with the impressive number of organized student groups that the campus currently enjoys.
