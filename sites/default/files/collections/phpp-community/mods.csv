G. Little.  The house was later purchased by a group of Grinnell College trustees to serve as the college president's home.  H.G. Little built his new home at 1127 Park Street. That house is no longer standing.

Hamlin at this address. She is also listed in the 1894-95 City Directory.  Changes to the original building included cutting off the SE corner bay window and making a picture window, adding a wraparound veranda with pediment and enclosing the former bay window. The roof was raised and peaked to provide an attic with window.  One photo (B) is early, before the changes, and the other (A) shows the later modifications.

Parker School was built on the southeast corner of Spring Street and Sixth Avenue and named for Professor L.F. Parker, the school district's first superintendent and author of the two-volume History of Poweshiek County, Iowa. An Oberlin graduate, he taught, by himself, all classes from primary through high school during the first year.  Parker School replaced the Northwest School , which had been built at the same location in 1882 and was destroyed by fire.
As the years progressed the facility became outdated and failed to meet recommended standards. Parker's site area was only 1.2 acres and with an enrollment of 149 students in 1961-62 fell far short of the optimum site area of 6.5 acres. When constructed, it was on the outskirts of town, but the growth of residential areas caused its location to become outmoded and the fact that it was situated on U.S. Highway 6 created safety questions. In 1970 the School Board decided to demolish the building at the end of the school year. The building and land were sold at public auction for $24,000 (Grinnell Herald Register, August 19, 1971) and the building was razed on August 19."	1971	1971		1971-08-19	Poweshiek History Preservation Project		Robin Broders ~ provenance history					Wrecking | Parker School (Grinnell, Iowa) | Elementary school buildings		Grinnell (Iowa)		1970s | Grinnell | Education		Digital Grinnell ~ host | Poweshiek History Preservation Project ~ host	still image	photograph	3 sheets		image/tiff	digitized other analog		English ~ eng	grinnell:12860	http://hdl.handle.net/11084/12860			Copyright to this work is held by the author(s), in accordance with United            States copyright law (USC 17).

The Spencers owned the half block on the east side of Main Street between 6th and 7th Avenues. The house originally sat at 1116 Main Street with outbuildings and greenhouses to the north and a generous lawn to the south (visible on the right hand side of the picture.) The house was moved to the vicinity of the southeast corner of Pearl Street and 6th Avenue (the site of the public safety building in 2016). It was then moved a third time to 611 Sixth Avenue. For many years it was the Christian Science reading room and in 2016, it became a gift shop.  The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.	1882				Poweshiek History Preservation Project		Byron Hueftle-Worley ~ provenance history					Stereoscopic views | Architecture, Domestic		Grinnell (Iowa)		1880s | Grinnell | Business		Digital Grinnell ~ host | Poweshiek History Preservation Project ~ host	still image		2 images		image/tiff	digitized other analog		English ~ eng	grinnell:13249	http://hdl.handle.net/11084/13249			Copyright to this work is held by the author(s), in accordance with United            States copyright law (USC 17).

The elevator was built in 1917 and demolished in 2014. Itel Gillespie and Mac (Glenn) McCarel are standing in front of the elevator. On the verso of the photo is a handwritten history of the elevator and the town which was probably written in the late 1960s. It reads:
Newburg founded 1878. 100 years ago there were 2 grain elevators constructed of wood. Then in 1917-1918 a poured concrete elevator and a block warehouse were built and still in use. 3 grocery stores that burned. The present building that still stands was a grocery store, but now is an apartment house.  The railroad depot was demolished about 5 years ago. A water tank furnished water to the steam engines. A stock yard was available for the farmers cattle and hogs. We had our own post office. The creamery building still stands and did a route business and part of the building used as an ice house. We once had a prosperous bank, but it closed in 1933. There have been 2 blacksmith shops, a lumber yard. The farmers owned a telephone switchboard. One of the residents owned and operated a Model T agency. At one time we had 2 churches, the Church of God and the Congregational, this is now known as the UCC. A KP hall served as community center where the women gathered to sew during World War I. The lower floor housed new farm machinery. Our school is still operating and it now serves just 6th graders and one kindergarten class. In 1964 a newly formed organization known as Newburg Community Service Association dug a 225 foot well. It serves all homes business, school and church."	1940			1940? ~ Date Issued	Poweshiek History Preservation Project		Eleanor Osland ~ provenance history					Grain elevators		Newburg (Iowa)		1940s | Business | Agriculture		Digital Grinnell ~ host | Poweshiek History Preservation Project ~ host	still image	photograph	1 sheet		image/tiff	digitized other analog		English ~ eng	grinnell:20602	http://hdl.handle.net/11084/20602			Copyright to this work is held by the author(s), in accordance with United            States copyright law (USC 17).

The Spencers owned the half block on the east side of Main Street between 6th and 7th Avenues. The house originally sat at 1116 Main Street with outbuildings and greenhouses to the north and a generous lawn to the south (visible on the right hand side of the picture.) The house was moved to the vicinity of the southeast corner of Pearl Street and 6th Avenue (the site of the public safety building in 2016). It was then moved a third time to 611 Sixth Avenue. For many years it was the Christian Science reading room and in 2016 it became a gift shop for a few years. The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.	1882				Poweshiek History Preservation Project							Architecture, Domestic | Christian Science church buildings		Grinnell (Iowa)		Grinnell | Family Life | Organizations | 1880s		Digital Grinnell ~ host | Poweshiek History Preservation Project ~ host	still image	photograph	1 photograph, black and white		image/jpeg	digitized other analog		English ~ eng	grinnell:27170	http://hdl.handle.net/11084/27170			Copyright to this work is held by the author(s), in accordance with United States copyright law (USC 17).

He sold it to Bill Werneburg, Jr., in 1959. Werneburg operated it until 1965 selling it to Velma and Leonard Heinselman. In 1968 the Heinselmans remodeled and added a telephone ordering system. The Heinselmans operated it until 1975, when they sold it to Chuck McPherson. The McPherson family ran it until it was sold to Clarice Schweitzer. In 1979 an addition created seating for 125. The building was then purchased by Bruce and Laura Blankenfeld who then began operating it as a full service family restaurant. In July 2004 the building was given another facelift which is how you see it today (2019) -- the Westside Family Restaurant  located at 229 6th Avenue West, Grinnell, Iowa.	1950	1950?

The monument, dedicated on January 20, 1945, was designed and built by C.J. Zirbel and Harold Swanson.  It stood 27 feet high on an eight foot base with a peak at the top to emulate the Washington Monument. All four sides listed the names of servicemen and women in the vicinity. At some point in time the monument was torn down as it was built of wood and had deteriorated over the years.  The panels with the soldiers names may be at the Poweshiek County Historical and Genealogical Society. The scaffold in the background is because they were putting a new roof on the courthouse.	1945	May 6, 1945			Poweshiek History Preservation Project		Pat Rowell ~ provenance history					World War (1939-1945) | Soldiers' monuments | Rowell family		Montezuma (Iowa)		Montezuma | Government | 1940s		Digital Grinnell ~ host | Poweshiek History Preservation Project ~ host	still image	photograph	1 photograph, black and white		image/tiff	digitized other analog		English ~ eng	grinnell:27238	http://hdl.handle.net/11084/27238			Copyright to this work is held by the author(s), in accordance with United States copyright law (USC 17).
